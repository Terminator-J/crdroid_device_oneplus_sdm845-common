## Hola amiguitos

This is my attempt to fix up and add a little crDroid customization flavor back into the sdm845-common device tree for OnePlus 6 & 6T (enchilada & fajita).

Rebased on the official lineage-21 branch with lineage-22 bringup patches from the LineageOS device tree as of October 2024.
